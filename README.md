# Admin-Dashboard

The goal of this project is to make a full admin dashboard with whatever tools necessarry.
It should look like this https://cdn.statically.io/gh/TheOdinProject/curriculum/main/html_css/grid-lessons/project-dashboard/dashboard-project.png


At completion, this project is one of my most impressive works of css. Everything looks clean and is aligned, and I like the color scheme I chose to play with. 

With an understanding of both flexbox and grid, this work has also become far easier. Most of my issues in previous projects came from trying to force flexbox to do things that grid can accompliosh with no issue. 

In the future I may come back to this page and make it functional.
